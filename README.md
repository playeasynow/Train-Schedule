v1.0 \
Orig. Deployment - September 29, 2018

# Idea
My first attempt at using firebase! Since I became comfortable working on firebase, I took the opportunity to focus on the UI a bit more! I used Google's Material Design for the aesthetic.

# User Guide

Here's how it works:

- Scroll down and submit the following:
-- Train Name
-- Destination
-- First Train Time -- in military time
-- Frequency -- in minutes
- Then, the app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this will be relative to the current time.
- Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.
- Have fun!

The game uses a basic Firebase database, so good for a great first run at playing with a remote database!
